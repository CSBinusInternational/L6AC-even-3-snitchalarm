Title:House Break-in Silent Alarm


Current Setting:

Nowadays, the development of pervasive computing is proven to be beneficial in multiple sectors, which includes the security of properties and houses. People generally lock their doors and leave home, hoping that thieves do not attempt to break in their houses. With pervasive computing, alarms via email can be sent to your phone allowing any break in attempts to be recorded. 


Problems and Issues:

Burglars breaking in houses often get uncaught even when we report them to the police. This is due to several issues.
- We do not know when a burglar breaks in our house immediately.
- We do not know who opened the room
- Crime rates would only increase until houses are equipped with security features which would help the capture of thieves.


Project:

The solution that will be developed is a silent alarm that is going to be put on a door of the house, such that when a break-in happens, the alarm will give an email to the user notifying that the house's door has been opened. This allows the user to get the information of a break-in, even though the house is already locked. 

Furthermore, our project can detect the presence of the house owner inside the house. Such that no alarm will be sent to the owner's email if the owner himself is the one who opens the door. This is done with the help of sensor-free presence detector to know whether the owner's device is connected to the home wifi (which means that the owner is in the house).
